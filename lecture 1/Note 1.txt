// Your First Program

class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!"); 
    }
}
static : pie 
void : each method return one thing
main method 
arguments : string args[] (vector of strings)
constructor : return object of the class
evrything that cannot be number or char it gonna be object

create an object using constructor 

an object is an instant of class


abstraction:
object : should be black box (need to drive the car and no how the car drives)
interface

encapsulation : 
hide internal information from outside
bank, cars (you dont care about what i made when i build a new car, you just drive)

inheritance:
studend (superclass), masterstudent (subclasses)
masterstudent inherites alle the methods exept constructors, ptotected

polymorphism:
object that can refer to multiple classes
generic methods (sort the objects that have same type) 

1-attributes
2-constructor
3-methods

person is a class when we create an instant it will be an object.
